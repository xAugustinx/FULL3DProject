CMake Warning at CMakeLists.txt:8 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindopenGL.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "openGL", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "openGL" with any
  of the following names:

    openGLConfig.cmake
    opengl-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "openGL" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "openGL_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "openGL"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
